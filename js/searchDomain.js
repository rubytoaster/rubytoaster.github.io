Process machines are designed to exceed customer expectations, reduce Work In Process (WIP), and increase throughput to expose capacity for increased warfighter support. In addition, process machines must be customer focused and directly aligned with customer requirements.

In its most basic sense, speed equals reduced flowtime. AoP creates a methodology that measures performance in a manner that focuses the organization on the weakest link in their processes. This focus leads to process improvement initiatives that affect the speed of throughput for the organizational process.

However, considering time, money, space, manpower and other severe constraints facing us, we must leverage speed. AFSC’s workforce must not cling to an inefficient process out of a fear of change. We must free up limited resources by increasing the speed, in other words reducing wasted time and effort.

It is not about hurrying, or cutting corners, nor is speed obtained on the backs of the workforce. Speed must be achieved through improved processes, an enterprise focus, and a common agreement and understanding of the goal of speed. Speed must be mindful of safety and quality. The AFSC recognizes that speed without quality is not beneficial; therefore the focus on speed is about understanding the processes that fuel our execution, both on and above the shop floor, and improving those processes with the goal of making the\
  processes more expedient. AoP’s focus on efficiency serves to create speed while improving quality and safety – making quality and safety integral parts of the process.",

  to get what you want – that will not even be an option outside your own area – it is about using data, facts, and logic to convince or motivate others to take a particular course of action. In the context of process management, influence is focused on mission accomplishment and organizational success. Using AoP helps break down organizational barriers and fosters relationships with internal and external customers, suppliers, and mission partners.

  increase the level of throughput in all of our processes….THROUGHPUT IS KING. A properly designed process machine provides a methodical approach to assessing throughput performance and allows AFSC to communicate changes and impacts in a common language. Well-built process machines allow users to adjust for known changes, such as increased or decreased requirements, and understand how to fine tune the process machine to achieve improved performance.

Gates need to show the processes of the process machine, but do not need to detail every sub-process or sub-task within the specific gates (see graphic). It is also important to ensure the gates are not so long that it becomes difficult to monitor the progress or determine failure points within the gate. The ability (or\

All levels of management must monitor the performance of the gates and the process. Metrics must be in place from the shop floor to the senior leader conference rooms, and they must be aligned for optimum process machine performance. While properly\
  designed process machines and the monitoring tools discussed in this handbook are meant to limit the impacts of variation on an operation, significant variation will still create serious perturbations to a process machine. Drastically changing the number or mix of WIP inducting in the process machine during execution will create ineffectiveness in AFSC operations. Major constraints during process execution can also reduce the throughput of the process machines. It is important that everyone recognize that\
  process variation is the enemy.",
