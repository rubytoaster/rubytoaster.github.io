<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 18px;">A Leader's Guide to Wall Walks</span><br>
<p>A wall walk is a recurring process-focused review to understand process machine perfor-mance, identify constraints, and coordinate constraint resolution at the operational level. Wall walks utilize visual displays set up around process execution gates. They use data to allow an organization to understand how the process machine is performing.</p>
<p>The following sets of questions can help you assess your wall walks and encourage discussion: Is it on a wall? Can you see the gates clearly? What process is displayed? What are the gate names? How long does the process take? What mission partners are involved? Is the wall meaningful from the perspective of the process-doer?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Flow:</span> Is there flow, i.e. movement of work in process (WIP) through the machine? Can you see movement across the wall in some way -examples include: a bar chart or other visual or numerically as in WIP and flowtime numbers. What does your process look like? What drives the steps? Do you have a chart or diagram?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Machine Design:</span> Consider the following critical attributes: Does the wall walk follow basic AoP core tenets? There should be some familiarity with the leadership model. There should be a visual process machine based on the horizontal bars of the radiator chart (i.e. a reasonable understanding of the process and the AoP approach), flow established, WIP identified, constraint(s) identified, constraint(s) resolved or a plan to resolve constraint(s). How did you design your wall? Who was involved? How long have you been doing wall walks?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Work in Process (WIP):</span> There should be some indication of how much work is in the machine and where it is located (gates, queues, etc.). Look for data cards, WIP numbers, or gate charts showing WIP breakdowns. WIP control increases process speed and quality and reduces cost by ending multi-tasking and lack of focus. WIP is controlled by setting WIP limits using Little's Law or some other mechanism, establishing queues when necessary. How much WIP is there in this process? How do you control WIP?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Constraint Identification:</span> If the machine is designed correctly you should quickly see a noticeable area of the process where there appears to be a problem or constraint (i.e. gate with the lowest throughput rate, excessive WIP, excessive time, etc.). What is your primary constraint? Why do you think so? This should be based on data, not instinct, experience, etc.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Root Cause:</span> What do you think the root cause is for the constraint? How do you know? Can you show me? Results should be based on the data.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Constraint Resolution:</span> How did you resolve the constraint or what is your plan to resolve it by exploiting, subordinating, elevating? There should be a plan to resolve the constraint. Ideally, the plan will be posted on the wall near the constraint gate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rework:</span> Is there a way to see rework on the wall? Is there any significant rework in the process? How do you track it? Do you use the information to improve the process?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Schedule</span> and Routine: How often do you have a wall walk? Who is involved? What do you think about it? Be sure to talk to team members and ask how they use the board?</p>
<p>Relentless leadership is necessary to drive a meaningful wall walk and to manage the work-load. For more on information on wall walks, reference Chapter 6 in AFSCH 60-101.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size: 18px;">AoP FAQs and Misconceptions:</span><br>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">A wall walk is a briefing to visiting leaders?</span></p>
<p>Wall walks are NOT briefings to leadership. They are process-focused meetings designed to identify and mitigate the leading constraint impacting the process. Wall walks must include all enterprise teammates and subject matter experts to resolve gaps and improve process. Wall walks also present the opportunity for leaders to provide guidance and encouragement to members of their organization. Wall walks are the heart beat of AoP. They are essential to allow organizations to understand how the process machine is performing with measured data and to identify constraints to coordinate constraint resolution. Wall walks utilize the process machine, which is a visual representation of the process showing flow, WIP, and gate performance; to identify the con-straining gate. While the process machine and other visual displays may make the meeting space ideal for briefing leadership, a wall walk is NOT a briefing.</p>
